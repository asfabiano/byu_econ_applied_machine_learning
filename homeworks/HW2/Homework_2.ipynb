    "## Introduction to Modeling with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen some examples of modeling and using Python for modeling, we wanted to give you a chance to try your hand!\n",
    "\n",
    "To that goal, we choose a well structured problem with plenty of resources online to help you along the way. That problem is predicting housing prices and is hosted on Kaggle:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you are signed up on Kaggle and then download the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes both testing and training sets as well as a sample submission file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is the predict the sales price for each house where root mean squared error is the evaluation metric. To get some ideas on where to start, feel free to check out Kaggle Kernels:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "And the discussion board:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Again - the goal of this homework is to get you exposed to modeling with Python. Feel free to use online resources to help guide you, but we expect original thought as well. Our hope is by the end of this homework you will feel comfortable exploring data in Python and building models to make predictions. Also please submit your test results to Kaggle and let us know your ranking and score!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is due **Feb. 20, 2018 by 3:00pm Utah time.** By that time, you need to have committed all your code to your github and submitted a link to your work to the TA. We can see on your Github account when you last committed code. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubric:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code Quality - 10%\n",
    "* Storytelling - 10%\n",
    "* Result on Kaggle - 5%\n",
    "* Describing, Cleaning, and Visualizing data - 25%\n",
    "* Modeling - 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, for modeling we will look for: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Model Selection: Did you try multiple models? Why did you choose these models? How do they work? What are they assumptions? And how did you test/account for them? How did you select hyper-parameters?\n",
    "* Model interpretation: What do the model results tell you? Which variables are important? High bias or variance and how did you / could you fix this? How confident are you in your results? \n",
    "* Model usefulness: Do you think your final model was useful? If so, how would you recommend using it? Convince us, that if we were a company, we would feel comfortable using your model with our users. Think about edge cases as well - are there certain areas that the model performs poorly on? Best on? How would you handle these cases, if say Zillow wanted to leverage your model realizing that bad recommendations on sale prices would hurt customer trust and your brand. This section also falls into the storytelling aspect of the grading."
